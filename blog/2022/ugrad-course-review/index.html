Both James and Robert were fantastic teachers, making the course not only interesting but supremely enjoyable. The <a href="/notes/">thermodynamics</a>, special relativity, waves and quantum mechanics units were the personal highlights.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - A definite step up from high school physics, and some of the units were quite conceptually challenging (e.g. thermodynamics, special relativity, quantum mechanics).</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 5/5 - I can’t imagine a better introduction to the subject.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-107---enriched-experimental-physics-i-">PHYS 107 - Enriched Experimental Physics I <a id="course-PHYS107" name="course-PHYS107"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Joss Ives</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> None.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Experimental Design and Iteration, Using Excel, Uncertainty Estimation, Uncertainty Propogation, Mean and Standard Deviation, Model Fitting and Residuals. Experiments done were Hooke’s Law, Pendulum Period, Single-Slit Diffraction, RC Circuits, Light Intensity.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I definitely appreciate this course more in retrospect (though I may be biased as I have now TA’d it a few times). I find myself still coming back to the lessons learned in this course years later when thinking about measurements, uncertainty, and statistics; thus (to me) showing that the course did a great job in laying the groundwork of experimental investigation. Joss and the TAs (Austin de St. Croix, Adam Dvorak) were all very experienced and helpful. The format of having to finish the entire lab and hand in notebooks at the end of period I found stressful at the time, but also helps to keep the lab contained. The Single-Slit Diffraction lab and the Light Intensity Labs were my favourites.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - There are quite a few new concepts here and being such a departure from previous encounters with experiments, it can be a lot to take in. The pacing is also a bit stressful.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - I honestly didn’t enjoy the course too much at the time, so don’t want to rate it too high; that said it is a course that I find extremely valuable in retrospect and can almost universally recommend.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-109---enriched-experimental-physics-ii-">PHYS 109 - Enriched Experimental Physics II <a id="course-PHYS109" name="course-PHYS109"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Joss Ives</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> None.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Everything covered in PHYS 107, as well as Log-log/semi-log plots and \(\chi^2\) fitting. Experiments done were Radiation shielding, Index of refraction, Spring-mass oscillation, Distance dependence of quadrapole potential, LR circuits, Standing waves.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> The same comments apply from the 107 labs. More of the experiments here were over two weeks, and having already learned many of the basic concepts these experiments felt like using the toolset we had built up in 107; therefore it overall felt less stressful. I also found a higher proportion to be interesting (radiation shielding, index of refraction, quadrapole potential, standing waves) so I enjoyed these labs a little more. One note for future students: The structure of the first-year labs has now changed, so the sequence is now PHYS 119 in first term and PHYS 129 in second term (for Science One/Honours Physics students).</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 3/5 - Easier to deal with after the slight cognitive overload of concepts in 107.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 4/5 - Many small factors that make the second half of first-year labs slightly more enjoyable.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-200---relativity-and-quanta-">PHYS 200 - Relativity and Quanta <a id="course-PHYS200" name="course-PHYS200"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Douglas Scott</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> <em>Special Relativity</em> by Helliwell.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Historical Development of Special Relativity, Time Dilation, Length Contraction, Relativity of Simultaneity, Lorentz Transformations, Spacetime Intervals and Invariants, Relativistic Momentum and Energy, Historical Development of Quantum, Photoelectric Effect, Quantum States and Eigenstates, Superposition, Position and Momentum Wavefunctions, Measurement, Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, Time Evolution and the Schrodinger Equation, Infinite Square Well, Absorption and Emission.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> This course was fun! I do wish it was more mathematically rigorous, but that has to wait until later courses. Douglas was a very sarcastic and entertaining lecturer. It is notable that around 50% of the material will be review coming from Science One.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 3/5 - Relativity and QM are notorious for being tricky conceptually. But if one engages with the course material, doing well is not too difficult.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - Fun, but has the potential to be better! Perhaps I would have also enjoyed it a bit more if I hadn’t learned the concepts already in Science One.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-203---thermal-physics-i-">PHYS 203 - Thermal Physics I <a id="course-PHYS203" name="course-PHYS203"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Joanna Karczmarek</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> <em>An Introduction to Thermal Physics</em> by Schroeder.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Probability, Laws of Thermodynamics, Temperature, The Partition Function, Ideal Gases, Equipartition Theorem, Heat Capacities, Heat Engines, Macrostates and Microstates, Entropy, 2-State Paramagnet, Einstein Solid, Enthalpy and Free Energy, Chemical Potential, Thermochemistry, Thermodynamics of Water, The Steam Engine, Canonical and Grand Canonical Ensembles, Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein Statistics, Density of States, Blackbody Radiation.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Super interesting material. Joanna is a very acute and clear prof, and the class has a nice style of being mixed lecture/tutorial (with the first part of each class being lecture with clicker problems, and the second part working on problems as a group). The statistical mechanics portions of the course are by far my favourite, and I loved seeing how previous familiar results from thermodynamics fall out of statistical mechanics. The thermochemistry portion of the course was not conceptually or mathematically difficult but strangely gave me quite a bit of trouble (mostly with signs and what quantities to use), and I don’t think I understood Fermi-Dirac/Bose-Einstein statistics or Density of States until the fourth year stat mech course. But overall covers so much neat material and covers it so well that I don’t have much to complain about.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 4.5/5 - Covers a lot of material, and a lot of it is novel and not initially intuitive.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 5/5 - The best second-year physics course by some margin.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-210---introduction-to-computational-physics-">PHYS 210 - Introduction to Computational Physics <a id="course-PHYS210" name="course-PHYS210"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Carl Michal</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> None; but <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Think Python</em></a> by Downey was an optional resource.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Linux and Terminal Usage, Coding in Python, Numbers and Strings, NumPy, Arrays and Broadcasting, Functions, File I/O, Conditionals, SciPy Fitting, Loops, Matplotlib, Containers, Animation, Numerical Methods for ODEs and PDEs, Simulations.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> This course teaches you how to program like a physicist (i.e. it does a good job teaching you what you need to know to get programming, if not as formal as you would learn in a computer science program). At the end I came out with a nice grasp of basic python. Carl and the TAs (particular shoutout to Colby Delise) are super helpful with helping you to learn and troubleshoot, which is super important for an intro programming course where the potential for frustration is high. The assessments were super fair; it was the first course pre-COVID where googling anything during programming tests was allowed. Simulation projects that made up the second half of the course were the highlight; the Ising model and Gas simulations were my favourites.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 2.5/5 - I think the difficulty of this course largely boils down to how quickly one can become comfortable with programming; I didn’t struggle with it too much, but could see it being more difficult for others. I could certainly see some prior experience with programming helping.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 4/5 - A good intro to Physics programming, with some great projects!</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-216---intermediate-mechanics-">PHYS 216 - Intermediate Mechanics <a id="course-PHYS216" name="course-PHYS216"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Ludovic Van Waerbeke</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> <em>Classical Mechanics</em> by Taylor.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Newton’s Laws, Cylindrical/Spherical Polar Coordinates, Air Resistance and Trajectories, Charge in B-field, Momentum, Angular Momentum, Kinetic and Potential Energy, Conservative Forces, Simple Harmonic Motion, Damped and Driven Damped Oscillators, The Euler-Lagrange Equations, Lagrangian Mechanics, The Two-Body Problem, Kepler Orbits, Non-Inertial Frames, Fictitious Forces, Rigid Body Rotation, The Inertia Tensor.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> A good re-intro to mechanics! Ludo is clear and also very rigorous (and he makes a point of instilling this rigour in the students, which I think is very useful). First half of the course is first-year material but done more formally, now that students are more familiar with vectors and calculus (so doesn’t feel like a waste of time). Second half of the course is where the course really picks up, with highlights like Lagrangian mechanics, orbital mechanics, non-inertial frames, and rotation.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - Definitely trickier than previous encounters with mechanics, and there is a lot to chew on; but nothing that can’t be understood with effort and time spend solving problems.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - Overall an enjoyable course that formalizes what came before, and introduces many new enjoyable topics in mechanics.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-219---intermediate-experimental-physics-i-">PHYS 219 - Intermediate Experimental Physics I <a id="course-PHYS219" name="course-PHYS219"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructors:</strong> Rob Kiefl &amp; Andrzej Kotlicki</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> None.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Circuit Construction, Oscilloscopes, Function Generators, RC Circuits, AC Filters, LCR Circuits, Semiconductor Diodes, Transistors, Operational Amplifiers, AM Radio Receivers.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Probably my least favourite lab course of the bunch. Tutorials were confusing and the course as a whole was quite time-consuming between longer experiments and lab reports. The experiments all center around circuits which aren’t really my cup of tea in terms of areas of physics (really felt like an engineering course at times). I did come out with a good grasp of the basics of circuits though, and with effort it isn’t hard to do well. Luke Reynolds was an absolute gem of a TA, and I was blessed to have him here (as well as two more courses after this). The final project at the end of building a AM Radio from all the components learned in the course thus far was a really good way to end off the course.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 2.5/5 - The course is more time-consuming than difficult, but does occasionally require banging one’s head against the wall (or calling a TA for help) when things don’t work.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 2.5/5 - Not particularly fun, but saved by a great final project and TA.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-229---intermediate-experimental-physics-ii-">PHYS 229 - Intermediate Experimental Physics II <a id="course-PHYS229" name="course-PHYS229"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Douglas Bonn</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> None.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Experimental Design and Iteration, Scientific Writing, Producing Figures. Experiments done were determining the transfer function of a system via Fourier analysis, Measurement of the gas constant, and Measuring heat expansion of metal with laser interferometry.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Though PHYS 219 in the previous term had my expectations low, this lab course was a hit! You get to choose three experiments you want to do throughout the term, and there are some really interesting choices available (e.g. how do you measuring the gas constant with a toy syringe, heat expansion measured using lasers, harmonics of a 3D box). The course also had a nice overarching theme/goal of learning how to write scientific papers. Doug is also a standout prof, being super pedagogical and patient.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 2.5/5 - All experiments in the course have problems to work through, but with thought and effort it is not hard to do well.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 4.5/5 - My favourite lab course of my undergrad.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-301---electricity-and-magnetism-">PHYS 301 - Electricity and Magnetism <a id="course-PHYS301" name="course-PHYS301"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Joerg Rottler</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> <em>Introduction to Electrodynamics</em> by Griffiths.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Vector Fields, Div-Grad-Curl, The Dirac Delta Function, The Electric Field, Gauss’s LawElectric Potential, Work and Energy, Conductors, Laplace’s Equation, The Method of Images, Separation of Variables, Multipole Expansion, Polarization, Electric Displacement, Dielectrics, Lorentz Force Law, Biot-Savart Law, Ampere’s Law, Magnetic Vector Potential, Magnetization, Auxiliary Fields, Electromagnetic Induction, Faraday’s Law, Maxwell’s Equations.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Very bread and butter physics course in terms of content, but done very well. All problems in the course were symbolic, which was greatly appreciated. Joerg was a good lecturer, with lectures having a nice clicker/problem solving format. Denis Uhland was possibly the friendliest TA I have ever had.

First half of the course with solving the SE for different potentials was a bit on the meh side (though there are valuable lessons learned from each of these cases, and the quantum harmonic oscillator is a neat problem), but gets more fun in the second half with topics such as the bra-ket formalism and angular momentum. The tutorials lead by Arnab Adhikary were easily the best part of the course, where many interesting problems were tackled.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - Can be occasionally tricky as many of the problems dealt with are departures from techniques used in other parts of physics.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - Certainly enjoyable, but unfortunately the first course in quantum mechanics is left having to cover some content that isn’t the most interesting.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-306---advanced-mechanics-">PHYS 306 - Advanced Mechanics <a id="course-PHYS306" name="course-PHYS306"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Joerg Rottler</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> <em>Classical Mechanics</em> by Taylor.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> The Variational Principle, Generalized Momenta and Ignorable Coordinates, Lagrange’s Equations for Holonomic Systems, Lagrangians for Electromagnetic Fields, Symmetries and Conservation Laws, Lagrange Multipliers, Coupled Oscillators, Normal Coordinates, Non-inertial Frames, Focault Pendulum, Rigid Body Rotational Motion, Inertia Tensor, Principle Axes of Inertia, Euler’s Equations, Spinning Top, Euler Angles, Hamiltonian Mechanics, Phase Space and Canonical Transformations, The Poisson Bracket, Liouville’s Theorem, Scattering Theory, Differential Cross Section, The Wave Equation, Stress and Strain, Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> All the fun stuff left in mechanics now that the fundamentals have been covered in 216. Some of the material is revisited (e.g. Lagrangian Mechanics) but is explored with more depths. Some neat problems, though the course as a whole is pretty heavy handed with the amount of algebra required. The initial worksheet format of the lectures didn’t work great for me as online made collaboration difficult, but the course adapted later on. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics are probably the most core and interesting parts of the course. Unfortunate that the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation wasn’t covered.

A surprising amount of ground is covered (whirlwind tour through binary, assembly, and C with some initial labs) and a <a href="/courseprojects/">personal project</a> to drive it home (with the potential to create a lot of neat stuff). However, when things didn’t work in this course, it was beyond frustrating, and unfortunately a lot of the course is spent troubleshooting. Our section was blessed with two amazing lab TAs (Luke Reynolds and Colby DeLise) which were very helpful in these frustrating moments. Andrzej was very helpful as well.

The material failed to engage me for the most part; but this can be just a subjective dislike of E&amp;M compared to other subfields of physics. The special relativity unit at the end was the only highlight for me content-wise (everything else lacked the intrigue that physics courses usually inspire). The homeworks and exams had a bizarre emphasis on numbers; I personally think calculators should be thrown out of physics courses after second year.

Robert’s approach (following Sakurai loosely) felt more mathematically formal compared to other physics courses, which probably lead to my added enjoyment of the course. This course felt like a self-contained journey through the most interesting bits of quantum mechanics. The course as a whole felt like it respected my time with interesting + pedagogical problems. The quantum information portion of the course (centering around entanglement) was fascinating (but I admit to heavy bias). The portion of the course on symmetries was also great. Content felt advanced, but explained very clearly and patiently.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 4/5 - Definitely a more advanced approach to quantum mechanics.

The course structure felt a bit disorganized/chaotic, but there is a lot of interesting concepts here to think about. Stamp likes to often give historical context for discoveries and developments, and lectures therefore have a nice story-like flow to them (even if explanation of topics can be occasionally unclear). I don’t think I completely understood some of the topics introduced in the course (e.g. Bose Einstein Condensation) but I did enjoy the material.

As a whole enjoyable, but as a whole taught me that Astronomy was not quite my cup of tea. Douglas was sarcastic and entertaining as usual, and clearly an expert in the field. Too many numbers for a fourth year course but perhaps inevitable. I also think the later content was more difficult to grasp, yet the available problems didn’t cover the material well (that is to say, doing the textbook problems from the later chapters didn’t particularly help in my understanding of the material). The <a href="/courseprojects/">poster project</a> was fun, the exams were not. They were much too long, and although the problems are just taken from the textbook and/or reading quizzes (of which I did <a href="/solutions/">every single one</a>), this tests memorization of how to solve problems rather than actual problem-solving skill which I don’t agree with.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - Nothing mathematically hard, but towards the end there are some harder concepts to grasp (e.g the CMB, Inflation, Structure Formation).</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 3.5/5 - Nice to finally understand the universe, but not sure if I enjoyed the course as much as I would have liked to.</li> </ul> <h4 id="phys-449---honours-thesis-">PHYS 449 - Honours Thesis <a id="course-PHYS449" name="course-PHYS449"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Rob Kiefl &amp; Robert Raussendorf (supervisor)</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> None.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Scientific Writing, Scientific Presentations, Conducting Research.

The research was difficult but enjoyable and I learned quite a bit about the field (and am excited to pursue quantum computation further in graduate school). Perhaps one comment is that it is difficult to partition time between research and the high courseload in undergrad (and graduate school applications…). The opportunities to write and present are valuable, but perhaps there are one too many hoops to jump through (one not only needs to do a final presentation and thesis, but also a thesis proposal, a proposal presentation, and a progress report; perhaps some of this distracts from actual time spent doing research work).</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 5/5 - Conducting original research is hard (even with extensive support from supervisors), and so is writing and presenting about it.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 4.5/5 - Research is slower and less linear than coursework (of course), but also more meaningful.</li> </ul> <h3 id="2-math-">2.

There was a tricky, proof-based assignment for the first assignment and subsequent assignments were made too easy. I feel more proofs would set students up better for future mathematics courses, and as it stands I would recommend students interested in mathematics MATH 120/121 over Science One. Taeuk (Nam) was a fantastic TA. I found the first part of the course (Differential Calculus) to be much easier having done Calc AB, but the second half (Integral Calculus) was more novel.

I regret not taking MATH 226/227 which were more proof-based and went into more depth.

The units on Riemann-Stieltjes integration and Sequences/Series of functions are the best, with the course peaking with the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem; after that (going into special functions) my interest in the course dropped off a little. Slade is crystal clear in lecture as usual, and it really helps to have such a clear guide when the material is conceptually tricky (and Rudin is so terse). Adam Martens was also a very supportive TA. Exams and assignments continue to be challenging, as in MATH 320. My lecture notes for the two courses can be found <a href="/notes/">here</a>.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 4.5/5 - On par or more difficult than 320, but I got used to it.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 4/5 - Great, though not hitting quite the same highs as MATH 320.</li> </ul> <h4 id="math-322---introduction-to-group-theory-">MATH 322 - Introduction to Group Theory <a id="course-MATH322" name="course-MATH322"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Vinayak (Nike) Vatsal</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> <em>Abstract Algebra</em> by Dummit/Foote.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Group Axioms, Dihedral Groups, Symmetric Groups, Matrix Groups, Homomorphism and Isomorphism, Subgroups, Centralizers and Normalizers, Stablizers and Kernels, Cylic Groups, Quotient Groups, Cosets and Lagrange’s Theorem, Isomorphism Theorem, Transpositions and the Alternating Group, Group Actions, The Sylow theorems.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I was excited to learn about abstract algebra, but unfortunately was dissapointed. The course felt pretty unorganized, with the lectures unclear and not feeling entirely connected to the homework problems and exams (which were absolutely brutal in terms of difficulty). The course also unfortunately suffered from a lack of motivation a lot of the time, which is unfortunate as the applications and consequences of group theory are immense and fascinating. I ended up withdrawing from the course, but am still looking forwards to learning about algebra in the future.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 5/5 - Probably the most I’ve ever struggled with a course. But this could also just be that algebra doesn’t click as quickly for me as other fields of math.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 1/5 - Probably the most dissapointing mathematics experience of my undergrad, and I don’t think the course did such a beautiful subject justice.</li> </ul> <h4 id="math-418---probability-">MATH 418 - Probability <a id="course-MATH418" name="course-MATH418"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Gordon Slade</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> <em>A First Look at Rigorous Probability Theory</em> by Rosenthal.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Probability Spaces, \(\sigma\)-algebras, Probability Measures, Extension Theorems, Lebesgue Measure, Random Variables, Independence, Limsup and Liminf of Events, Borel-Cantelli Lemma, Tail Fields, Kolmogorov 0-1 Law, Distributions, Culmulative Distribution Functions, Expectation, Mean, Variance, Covariance, Modes of Convergence, Probability Inequalities, Weak and Strong Law of Large Numbers, Probabity Density Functions, Gambler’s Ruin, Convergence Theorems, Moment Generating Functions, Large Deviations, Weak Convergence, Characteristic Functions, Continuity Theorem, Central Limit Theorem, Uniform Integrability, Random Walks, Branching Processes, Percolation.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> A good introduction to rigorous probability theory, as the textbook title suggests. Great if you want further insight into the mathematical foundations of probability, but likely unnecessary for most physicists who just want to use it as a tool. Midterm was fair, final was brutal. Slade is clear and well-paced in lectures as usual, and his enthusiasm (probability being his field of research) is evident. I would probably reccomend taking this over MATH 420; as Mark Kac says, “Probability Theory is a measure theory with a soul”, and there is a nice mix of rigorous theory and application here.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 4.5/5 - The material and assessments are both challenging; unsurprising for a grad crosslisted course.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 4/5 - A clear but rigorous course; that said I think taking both this and MATH 318 was unnecessary, and while I think I understand probability at a deeper level having gone through it, I don’t know if the added insights were worth the stress.</li> </ul> <h4 id="math-420---real-analysis-i-">MATH 420 - Real Analysis I <a id="course-MATH420" name="course-MATH420"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Young-Heon Kim</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> <em>Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications</em> by Folland.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> \(\sigma\)-algebras, Measures, Outer Measures, Borel Measures, Measurable Functions, Lebesgue Integration, Modes of Convergence, Convergence Theorems, Product Measures, Multi-variable Integration and Fubini-Tonelli, Signed Measures, The Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym Theorem, Complex Measures, Differentiation on Euclidean Space, Norms, \(L^p\) spaces, Inequalities with Norms, Convolution, Optimal Transport.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Rigorous, but unfortunately a little dull. Some interesting results, but overall felt a bit too abstract and theoretical. Just take 418 if you want to see it in a more concrete context; 420 might only be worth it to take MATH 421 (Functional analysis) where the fruits of the labours of 420 can be appreciated. Kim was a good lecturer, though ocassionally a bit chaotic with blackboard organization. The homework and final exam were both hard but graded leniently.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 4.5/5 - The level of abstraction here makes it quite difficult; again unsurprising for a grad crosslisted course.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 3/5 - A little bit too abstract and not inherently interesting enough for me to fully appreciate.</li> </ul> <h4 id="math-426---introduction-to-topology-">MATH 426 - Introduction to Topology <a id="course-MATH426" name="course-MATH426"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Ben Williams</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> None; used <a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/426/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes</a> written by Williams. <em>Topology</em> by Munkres and <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Algebraic Topology</em></a> by Hatcher were optional resources.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Topological Spaces, Separation Axioms, Continuity, Generating Topologies, Induced Topologies (The Subspace and Product Topologies), Coinduced Topologies (The Quotient Topology), Closure, Interior, Boundary, Density, Sequences, Compactness, The Tube Lemma, Compactness in Metric Spaces, Compactifications, Connectedness, Path-Connectedness, Basic Category Theory, Homotopy, Homotopy Category and Homotopy Groups, Contractible Spaces, The Fundamental Groupoid, The Fundamental Group, The Van Kampen Thoerem, Quotient Maps, Topological Groups, Group Actions, Quotients by Group Actions, Covering Spaces, Fundamental Group Action, Lifting, Classification of Covering Spaces, Deck Transformation, Fundamental Groups of Quotients, Quotients by Subgroups, Quotients by Group Actions.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> In my top 2 favourite math courses. Ben is a good lecturer; quick but also clear, pedagogical but also very humourous. Homeworks had some really interesting problems and all felt meaningful (compared to the occasional feeling of doing meaningless exercises in other courses). Topology proofs tend to be very clean and/or theatrical, particularly with the algebraic flavour that Ben likes to give. Admittedly abstract (a point that was a negative for MATH 420), but so visual and enjoyable that it didn’t matter. My favourite part of the course was probably Homotopy Theory and the Fundamental Group. I will admit that my understanding nosedived in the last unit (covering spaces), but this could just be due to me having poor algebra skills.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 5/5 - A lot of terminology, and a lot of techniques. The point-set half of the course is alright in difficulty, but the algebraic topology half of of the course is difficult indeed.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 4.5/5 - Fantastic, and also feels like a nice way to end off a degree in mathematics, tying together analysis and algebra.</li> </ul> <h3 id="3-computer-science-">3.

Gregor was an effective instructor, and the flipped-classroom with problem-solving during class was a good format (as really the learning here is done by programming and solving problems, rather than just listening). At the end I came out of the course with the ability to solve some genuinely interesting and fairly complicated problems. The paradigm of functional programming was new to me and it was fun to be exposed to it here. Designing programs to draw fractals and solve sudoku puzzles were my favourites.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 2/5 - If one puts in practice, doing well is not too difficult (but this is quite subjective; the course is famously bimodal in its distribution).</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 4/5 - Quite rich and enjoyable, and I could reccomend it to almost anyone.</li> </ul> <h4 id="cpsc-210---software-construction-">CPSC 210 - Software Construction <a id="course-CPSC210" name="course-CPSC210"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Norm Hutchinson</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> None.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Object-oriented programming in Java, Methods, Classes, Objects, Variables, Conditionals, Loops, Data Abstraction, Types, Interfaces, Extensions, Overriding, Exception Handling, Testing, Cohesion and Coupling, Liskov Substitution, Refactoring, Composite and Observer Patterns, Iterators.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Pretty boring; software design doesn’t particularly interest me, and the course didn’t have enough substance.

Material is useful for laying the groundwork for further algorithms courses, and for software engineering job interview questions. Picking up C++ is useful, though I don’t feel as comfortable with the language as 110’s Racket or 210’s Java (but the point of 221 is not to teach C++, so this is understandable). Geoff was an effective lecturer, concepts were clear. Programming assignments had a bit too much frustrating debugging when things would go wrong (but had some cool final products). I also didn’t really like how basically everything in the course was autograded (there is some resolution that is lost under the eye of machines), but I can see how that would save time.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 2.5/5 - Everything here is fairly standard as long as one keeps up with the course content.</li> <li> <strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 3/5 - Not bad, but not great either; a very bread and butter computer science course.</li> </ul> <h4 id="cpsc-340---machine-learning-and-data-mining-">CPSC 340 - Machine Learning and Data Mining <a id="course-CPSC340" name="course-CPSC340"></a> </h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructor:</strong> Michael (Mike) Gelbart</li> <li> <strong>Textbook:</strong> None.</li> <li> <strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Programming in Python, Data and Visualization, Decision Trees, Supervised Learning, Probabilistic Classification, Non-Parametric Models, Ensemble Methods, Clustering, Outlier Detection, Least Squares, Nonlinear Regression, Gradient Descent, Robust Regression, Feature Selection, Regularization, Linear Classifiers, Feature Engineering, Kernels, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Maximum a Posteriori Estimation, Principal Component Analysis, Sparse Matrix Factorization, Reccomender Systems, Deep Learning, Convolutions, Convlutional Neural Networks.</li> <li> <strong>Thoughts:</strong> A fantastic introduction to machine learning. On the mathematical side. Lectures were entertaining and clear; Mike knows his stuff and how to explain difficult concepts. Homeworks were long but reaosnable and promoted understanding.

But, there are certainly many interesting things that are learned across the wide variety of topics covered. I learned how to think critically and write precisely. I was a personal fan of Pam’s heavily discussion-oriented lecture style, which seems all the more unique after reflecting on all the courses I have taken (most of which stick with the traditional lecture format).

The assignments were not particularly enjoyable. I do have fond memories of doing experiments with crabs and doing a field study at Bamfield Marine Science Research Station, but it seems unfair to give this course a high rating just because a single part of it took place during of my favourite university experiences.

A surprising amount of memorization. Drawing pictures for reactions I admit was sort of fun, and some mechanisms felt like puzzles. Not sure if John’s teaching style really clicked for me, though I do appreciate how laid back he was. I do felt there was a bit of a disconnect between profs who taught different sections; Jay (the instructor in charge)’s section seemed to cover the most relevant material (for the examinations), and as a result a 15% differential in the averages between sections was observed.

I was particularly intrigued by the birth of physics in the form of natural philosophy, and learning about various Ancient Greek cosmologies (and how they inspired later ideas). The course does demand a lot of you in terms of work (weekly discussion posts, class participation, essays, personal project etc.). As a whole other (later) schools/ideas in philosophy I do find more interesting, though.</li> <li> <strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> 2.5/5 - Nothing conceptually difficult (other than perhaps some of the discussion concerning Neoplatonism at the tail end of the course).
