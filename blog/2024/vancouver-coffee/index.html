I will go through each location I visited and discuss the coffee, the decor, and how amenable the space was for studying/working. I’ve ranked the shops into four tiers (S/A/B+/B/C) based on my level of recommendation (not ordered within a tier). Disclaimer: I am no professional, just a grad student that enjoys coffee. My standard order is a flat white. <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/LVw6C9YMumDTRvcc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a google maps list with all of my favourites.</em></p> <h3 id="s-tier-amazing---the-best-of-the-best">S-tier (Amazing - The best of the best)</h3> <h4 id="oide">Oide</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Granville Island Adjacent - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wF1uP4yBEAmTbkLH8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Minimalist menu, offering either espresso (black)/flat white (white)/matcha (green) and 1-2 pourover selections. A single, curated choice of roast is available per visit, and while the flavour varies each time, every time is delicious. Generally have very complex and fascinating tastes, very far from the average conception of coffee.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Minimalist (like their menu), slightly industrial decor. In the beautiful waterfall building complex.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> Not many tables (though there is one standing desk) and no Wi-Fi. More suited for drinking coffee and spending time with others, but I have worked here occasionally!</li> <li> <strong>Additional Notes:</strong> My favourite coffee shop in the city. Staff are also super friendly.</li> </ul> <h4 id="prototype">Prototype</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Downtown Eastside - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Lyq2TNTuTdbv2pDr8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a>, Olympic Village - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/91HyFgSUV6VwWF936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Has a fairly extensive selection of speciality roasts (roasted in Vancouver) both for espresso drinks and pourover. They have a “set” where you can try a roast as an espresso and a macchiato. Compared the “codex” roast (the standard espresso choice) which had a mix of fruitiness and chocolatiness/nutiness, and a columbian roast which was much more fruit/acidity forwards. Both were very tasty and sweet.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Downtown location is a small-medium shop with a cool dark/nature aesthetic. The new Olympic village location maintains the slightly funky/artsy vibe, but is much more spatious and brighter.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> Downtown location has a couple tables and Wi-Fi, Olympic village location has more space.</li> </ul> <h4 id="single-v">Single V</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Metrotown - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uuPYjAMCEMBjComC9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Cups all have cat art which is very cute. Serve espresso drinks as well as pourovers with a wide variety of interesting flavour notes (e.g. passionfruit). Coffee was very tasty - fruity and sweet but not overpoweringly acidic, with green apple as an apt flavour note.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Small shop, with a sleek white modern decor.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> On the smaller side, not many tables (though there is a counter) and no Wi-Fi. More suited for drinking coffee and spending time with others.</li> <li> <strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Barista was friendly, and checked in on how the coffee was. Also cute to see another (regular) customer bringing in coffees to share with the baristas. No tips.</li> </ul> <h4 id="yuan">Yuan</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Grandview-Woodland - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hxXpE1EWa4DmE3bP7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> A curated selection of specialty roasts (lots of light roasts especially), with enough choice to satisfy any preferred flavour profile. I tried a natural processed Rwandan coffee roasted in Kyoto as pourover - was delicious, very fruity (grape/mango notes) and floral.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Minimalist/Industrial, in line with the area.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> Relatively small, but has Wi-Fi and a few outlets for working!</li> <li> <strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Offered me very tasty sample while waiting!</li> </ul> <h3 id="a-tier-great---worth-a-trip-to">A-tier (Great - Worth a trip to)</h3> <h4 id="cowdog">Cowdog</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Shaughnessy - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/htQHYaocFQrzz9EbA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> First time here I tried a pourover from Luna roasters (a local roaster), very fruity and floral/tea-like. Second time I tried a flat white which was quite fruity/sweet. Also tried an iced strawberry matcha which was fresh, though could have slightly stronger matcha.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Small, warm wood/plant/flower aesthetic.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> A bit on the small side, with a couple tables inside and out, so better as a social space than for studying.</li> <li> <strong>Additional Notes:</strong> No tips. Also tried the FIKA tasting menu they offered, which was very nice though a tad expensive. First course was comparing plum blossom/black bean/golden osmanthus teas. Second course was comparing a house-roasted “Blackberry” coffee in espresso and macchiato form, with a cookie. Third course was a strong matcha shot with a madeline for dipping. Fourth course was pourover (same roast) with cardamom buns. Final course was a hojicha affogato. Service was very friendly and overall enjoyed this quite a bit!</li> </ul> <h4 id="moja">Moja</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Grandview-Woodland - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vm4NrkR2ZejhqBWX6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Medium-dark roast which is not normally my preference, but is very pleasant with an excellent brown sugar sweetness.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Rustic, open, and slightly low lighting.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> Nice selection of tables and Wi-Fi makes this a good working location.</li> </ul> <h4 id="nemesis">Nemesis</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Mount Pleasant - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/34c4L1h1NMmiNcsa9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Local roaster. Coffee has a touch of fruitiness without being overpoweringly sower, and a bit of chocolatiness; balanced cup. They also bring your drinks out to you.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Very interesting building; flower bulb style with open barista bar.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> A bit busy/loud for studying.</li> </ul> <h4 id="platform-7">Platform 7</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Kitsino - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7rKuArkWPDbnYYPb9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> They have a brew bar with a few flight options; you can either try one type of bean/roast prepared via three different method, or compare three different types of beans as pourover. I compared roasts from Indonesia/Guatemala/Rwanda, which were different levels of fruity.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Reminiscent of a train station.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> Could be good for either work or social outings. They have Wi-Fi, but on a time limit.</li> </ul> <h4 id="revolver">Revolver</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Gastown - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/aFwQYZ6mMjP13Koj7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Offer an espresso flight which allow you to compare two different roasts as shots/macchiatos (4 shots total) for a nice price. Generally offer a choice of at least one fruitier and one nuttier/chocolatier roast each day. I’ve tried both their flight and cappuccino (which is closer to a flat white) and both were very enjoyable.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Woody and classic, but sophisticated. Has a room to the left with some tables/the espresso bar and a separate room just for seating (including a larger communal table)</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> No Wi-Fi, but has enough seating that could work as a study spot - on a revisit saw a group of visual art students working together at the communal table on a project.</li> </ul> <h4 id="r-ki-coffee-lab">R Ki Coffee Lab</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Richmond-Landsdowne - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mNcfSdo9ZA7dVJhq8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Coffee is roasted in house, and the shop is very committed; they serve coffee and coffee only. Pourover and espresso drinks available. The standard roast is a medium roast with pleasant acidity and richness, but you can pay a little extra for a choice of their lighter specialty roasts.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Small, cozy space with coffee goods and equipment about, that lives up to the “coffee lab” name.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> No Wi-Fi and has a 90 minute limit; good for a quick study session, but better for a social outing.</li> </ul> <h4 id="saunter">Saunter</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Gastown - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/aFNce9HxgZQpimcSA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Nice frutiness/sweetness and body.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Modern wood/concrete/brick aesthetic, also with a very cute tucked away internal courtyard.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> On the smaller side but very quaint - would love to chill and think/work in the courtyard.</li> </ul> <h4 id="slo">SLO</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Riley Park - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/qxKKUHoXvtv7M6h99" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Fruity/acidic with nice sweetness and body.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Sleek/futuristic with woody furniture.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> Has Wi-Fi and outlets, but laptop use is limited to an hour. The strange acoustics make it quite echo-y, and it is a popular place, so possible but not the best study location.</li> </ul> <h4 id="sunny-m">Sunny M</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Richmond - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7XZSF3tNFLGtDS9r5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Curate a mix of speciality coffees and teas. Pourover, espresso, and other speciality drinks (and some sweets) are available. My first visit I tried a Columbian pourover that was very grapefruity. The second time I tried a flat white with a dark-chocolate liquor bonbon profile.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Very tiny/cozy shop with a clean white aesthetic.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> Quite small, so not super suited for work, unless during off hours.</li> </ul> <h4 id="timbertrain">Timbertrain</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Gastown - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7YvAkjBfPJcjfnjv9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Offers a selection of in-house roasts. Sweet and chocolatey but also fruity.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Small/medium store which combines a retro and futuristic vibe.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> A little small, but a possible study spot.</li> </ul> <h4 id="viva-java">Viva Java</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Richmond-Bridgeport - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fPEj5N537Nh8Wxrq9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Only serves espresso drinks, owner/roaster is a Turkish guy who’s been doing this for years. Very funny guy with good rapport and talks a big game about his craft. For what its worth, his coffee is very tasty - rich/flavorful, zero acidity, strong-tasting without any of the characteristic bitterness you would expect.</li> <li> <strong>Decor:</strong> Coffee stand aesthetic.</li> <li> <strong>Studying Potential:</strong> No seating (basically takeout only, with one outside picnic table) so not for studying.</li> </ul> <h3 id="b-tier-quite-good---not-quite-a-but-almost-there">B+-tier (Quite Good - Not quite A, but almost there)</h3> <h4 id="fresh-press">Fresh Press</h4> <ul> <li> <strong>Location:</strong> Richmond-Landsdowne - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BAFVYi6uG5j11ske7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <strong>Coffee:</strong> Coffee has a splash of fruity sweetness without being overpowering.
