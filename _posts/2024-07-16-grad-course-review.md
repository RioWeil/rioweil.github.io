**July 16, 2024.** *I previously reflected on my undergraduate coursework at the end of my BSc at UBC - with the MSc now coming to a close, I wanted to do the same for my graduate coursework. For each course I have taken, I will list the content covered, give my impressions and opinions, and give two ratings from 1-5; one of the difficulty of the course (relative to when I took it), and another on my overall enjoyment of it.*

#### PHYS 500 - Quantum Mechanics I <a id="course-PHYS500" name="course-PHYS500"></a>
- **Instructor:** Ariel Zhitnitsky
- **Textbook:** *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics* by Griffiths.
- **Topics Covered:** Angular momentum and spin, Electromagnetic interactions, Gauge invariance, Addition of angular momentum, Time-independent perturbation theory, Fine and hyperfine structure of Hydrogen, WKB approximation, Time-dependent perturbation theory, Spontaneous Emission, Electric transitions, Selection rules, Adiabatic approximation, Berry phase, Aharonov-Bohm Effect, Scattering and resonance scattering.
- **Thoughts:** Was fairly disappointed with this course - a lot of the material was upper-undergraduate level rather than graduate. I enjoyed learning about the Berry phase but other topics (Angular momentum, Perturbation theory, WKB, Transitions, Scattering) were pretty standard and not very interesting. Homework assignments tended to be long and not particularly rewarding. Ariel was enthusiastic but not very clear. Grading scheme weighted exams much too heavily. My lecture notes from the course can be found [here](/notes/).
- **Difficulty Rating:** 3.5/5 - Material not strictly hard, but moved fairly quickly.
- **Overall Rating:** 2/5 - Quantum could be done much better!

#### PHYS 500 - Quantum Mechanics I (TAd) <a id="course-PHYS500TA" name="course-PHYS500TA"></a>
- **Instructors:** Andrew Potter
- **Textbook:** *Introduction to Quantum Information Science Lecture Notes* by Scott Aaronson, *Quantum Computation* (lecture notes) by John Preskill, *Lectures on Quantum Mechanics* by Gordon Baym, *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics* by Shankar.
- **Topics Covered:** Postulates of quantum mechanics, Mixed states, Entanglement and entanglement entropy, Identical particles and exchange statistics, Time-dependent perturbation theory, Adiabatic motion and corrections, Charged particles in EM fields, Interaction of EM radiation and atoms, Relativistic fermions.
- **Thoughts:** Much more conceptually rich, with a higher level of sophistication in the approach/topics chosen as well as a more contemporary perspective on the subject. I sat in lectures as a TA and found them quite insightful, even on material I had come across previously.
- **Difficulty Rating:** 4.5/5 - The course was fast-paced and covered difficult concepts, and would be difficult to follow without effort or affinity for the material.
- **Overall Rating:** 4.5/5 - The 500 course I would have wanted to take! 

#### PHYS 502 - Condensed Matter Physics I <a id="course-PHYS502" name="course-PHYS502"></a>
- **Instructors:** Marcel Franz
- **Textbook:** *Solid-State Physics* by Ashcroft and Mermin
- **Topics Covered:** Solids as interacting quantum many-body systems, Second quantization for fermions and bosons, Electrons in solids, Boson systems, Electrons in periodic potentials, Semiclassical theory of conduction in metals, Electron-phonon interactions, Elements of superconductivity.
- **Thoughts:** A benchmark for a great course! The level of the material hovers between upper undergraduate and graduate, with Ashcroft and Mermin being supplemented by more modern second quantization formalism. Marcel was a very clear lecturer. The grading scheme (1/3 between homework/midterm/final) was fair, particularly as the exams were takehome (a welcome change). Didn't get to the most interesting bits of condensed matter theory but a great introduction. My lecture notes from the course can be found [here](/notes/).
- **Difficulty Rating:** 3/5 - Not strictly easy, but smooth pace and clarity of exposition made things very manageable.
- **Overall Rating:** 4.5/5 - My favourite graduate course taken at UBC.

#### PHYS 516 - Statistical Mechanics <a id="course-PHYS516" name="course-PHYS516"></a>
- **Instructors:** Gordon Walter Semenoff
- **Textbook:** None.
- **Topics Covered:** Fundamentals of statistical mechanics, Phase transitions and critical exponents, $$D = 1,2,3$$ Ising models, Mean field theory, Quantum field theory, Universality, Renormalization, Elementary conformal field theory.
- **Thoughts:** A course studying the Ising model from different perspectives for 3 months. Had interesting bits of insight but often too meticulous on details/hard to follow, particularly in the latter half of the course (where written sources/lecture notes as a reference also vanished...) Also hard to stay consistently interested when the model of study is quite singular, even if it is a good candidate system to showcase various techniques/phenomenology. Gordon is very sweet if hard to follow at times. Grade was based largely on (4) homework assignments with detailed tutorial-style calculations, plus a lightly-weighted oral midterm and final with conceptual questions. My lecture notes from the course can be found [here](/notes/).
- **Difficulty Rating:** 4/5 - The latter half of the course is quite technical and hard to grasp, but doing well in the course is not too hard with effort.
- **Overall Rating:** 3/5 - Interesting at times, but not my favourite - a bit too singular and technical in its focus. 

#### PHYS 526 - Quantum Field Theory I <a id="course-PHYS526" name="course-PHYS526"></a>
- **Instructors:** Gordon Walter Semenoff
- **Textbook:** *Quantum Field Theory: An Introduction* by Gordon Walter Semenoff.
- **Topics Covered:** Many-particle systems, Second Quantization, Symmetries and Noetherâ€™s theorem, Space-time symmetries, Scalar/Tensor/Vector fields, Emergent relativistic QFT, Dirac equation and Dirac QFT, Photons, Quantum Electrodynamics, Functional methods, Perturbation theory, Feynman diagrams, Renormalization of QED.
- **Thoughts:** A must-study subject for any theoretical physicist. Gordon's introduction to the subject is pretty well, especially with the understanding that the audience is not necessarily versed in graduate quantum mechanics and classical field theory/electromagnetism. Gordon is sweet but my conceptual understanding from lectures started to drop off towards the end of the course. I felt as I understood a given line in a calculation but didn't understand the concepts or how to actually use/do QFT very well. Grade was based largely on (8) homework assignments with detailed tutorial-style calculations, plus a lightly-weighted oral midterm and final with conceptual questions. This is a very nice scheme/division of testing different levels of understanding of the course. Homework assignments are not strictly difficult but take a very long amount of time to complete. My lecture notes from the course can be found [here](/notes/).
- **Difficulty Rating:** 5/5 - A famously difficult subject to understand. I don't think I really understood it, and I need another stab at it. That said, doing well in the course was not too hard with effort.
- **Overall Rating:** 3.5/5 - I felt as I didn't walk away with the appreciation I hoped I would have for the subject, but may just be a skill issue on my part. Still an interesting introduction and I'm glad for the first stab.

#### CPSC 536W - Topics in Quantum Computation <a id="course-CPSC536W" name="course-CPSC536W"></a>
- **Instructors:** Daochen Wang
- **Textbook:** *Lecture Notes on Quantum Algorithms* by Andrew Childs, *Quantum Computation* (lecture notes) by Richard Jozsa, *Quantum Computation* (lecture notes) by Ashley Montanaro.
- **Topics Covered:** Quantum query complexity, Grover's algorithm, Collision problems, Simon's problem, Period finding, Factoring, Hidden Subgroup Problem, Amplitude amplification, Quantum walk, Quantum phase estimation, Adversary method, Divide and conquer, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum signal processing.
- **Thoughts:** I only audited this course but enjoyed it! The course gave a rigorous overview both of very established quantum algorithms as well as current research problems in the field, all from a computer science lens. I found it quite insightful as a primer on quantum algorithms research, which is slightly orthogonal to my own research in quantum information. I did find that the lectures occasionally delved too deeply into the details and lost the sight of the big picture, but may just be the nature of the field. Grade was completely based on 4 assignments, which is the way to go with a topics course.
- **Difficulty Rating:** 4.5/5 - The material was very formal and at times research-level, and would be difficult to parse without a strong background in linear algebra and algorithms.
- **Overall Rating:** 4/5 - Enjoyable and insightful!
