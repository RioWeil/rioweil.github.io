**Problem Statement:** *Consider a pendulum which consists of a weight of mass $$M$$ attatched ot a fixed point by a rigid rod of length $$l$$. The only forces acting on the weight are gravity and the force due to the presence of the rigid rod. Assume that the rod is perfectly rigid, one end is attached to the fixed point, the other end is attached to the weight. Assume that, constrained by these attachments, the rod can take up any orientation, that it is free to move, that it has negligible mass and that its movement involves negligible friction.
This “spherical pendulum” has stable circular orbits where the height of the weight is a constant. Show that the stable circular orbits occur when and only when the height of the the weight is less than the height of the fixed point where the rod is attached.
If one considers a stable circular orbit and perturbs it slightly, stability implies that, for a sufficiently small perturbation, there is an oscillatory behaviour. Find the frequency of the oscillation as a function of the height of the stable orbit.*

**Solution:** We first construct the Lagrangian for this system, choosing spherical polar coordinates as the generalized coordinates. $$r = l$$ is fixed, $$\theta$$ measured from the bottom of the orbit is the polar angle, and $$\phi$$ is the azimuthal angle. The position of the pendulum in these coordinates is:

$$
\mathbf{r} = l\sin\theta\cos\phi \hat{x} + l\sin\theta\sin\phi \hat{y} + l\cos\theta \hat{z}
$$

Which has time derivative:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{r}} = l\left((\dot{\theta}\cos\theta\cos\phi - \dot{\phi}\sin\theta\sin\phi)\hat{x} + (\dot{\theta}\cos\theta\sin\phi + \dot{\phi}\sin\theta\cos\phi)\hat{y} -  \dot{\theta}\sin\theta\hat{z}\right)
$$

thus the kinetic energy is:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 = \frac{1}{2}ml^2(\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{\phi}^2\sin^2\theta).
$$

The potential energy of the pendulum is gravitational and takes the simple form:

$$
U = mgl(1-\theta)
$$

and thus the Lagrangian is:

$$
L = T - U = \frac{1}{2}ml^2(\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{\phi}^2\sin^2\theta) - mgl(1-\cos\theta).
$$

We obtain the equations of motion from the Euler-Lagrange equations for $$\theta$$ and $$\phi$$:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \implies \frac{d}{dt}\left(ml^2\dot{\phi}\sin^2\theta\right) = 0 \implies \ddot{\phi}\sin^2\theta + 2\dot{\phi}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta\cos\theta = 0.
$$

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \implies \frac{d}{dt}\left(ml^2\dot{\theta}\right) = ml^2\dot{\phi}^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - mgl\sin\theta \implies \ddot{\theta} = \dot{\phi}^2\sin\theta\cos\theta - \frac{g}{l}\sin\theta
$$

The $$\phi$$ equation tells us that the angular momentum in the $$z$$-direction of $$L_z = ml^2\dot{\phi}\sin^2\theta$$ is conserved. Thus substituting $$\dot{\phi} = L_z/ml^2\sin^2\theta$$ into the $$\theta$$ equation to remove the $$\phi$$ dependence, we obtain:

$$
\ddot{\theta} = \frac{L_z^2}{m^2l^4\sin^3\theta}\cos\theta - \frac{g}{l}\sin\theta.
$$

The equilibrium point is the $$\theta = \theta_0$$ that makes the RHS of the above vanish (since the equation is transcendental in $$\theta$$, it does not have a closed form). At this angle we have $$\color{blue}{\ddot{\theta} = 0}$$ which defines a circular orbit. For this circular orbit, we have that $$L_z = ml^2\dot{\phi}\sin^2\theta_0$$ (from the $$\phi$$ equation), and that $$\dot{\phi} = \sqrt{\frac{g}{l\cos\theta_0}}$$ (from the $$\theta$$ equation) and so:

$$
L_z = ml^2\sin^2\theta_0\sqrt{\frac{g}{l\cos\theta_0}}.
$$

We evaluate the stability of the orbit by Taylor expanding $$\ddot{\theta}$$ around the equilibrium point (with $$\delta\theta = \theta - \theta_0$$):

$$
\ddot{\delta \theta} \approx \ddot{\theta}(\theta=\theta_0) + \frac{d\ddot{\theta}}{d\theta}(\theta=\theta_0)\delta\theta.
$$

The first term evaluates to zero, and we calculate the second term to be:

$$
\ddot{\delta \theta} \approx \left(\frac{L_z^2}{m^2l^4}\frac{-\sin^4\theta_0 - 3\sin^2\theta_0\cos^2\theta_0}{\sin^6\theta_0} - \frac{g}{l}\cos\theta_0\right)\delta\theta = -\left(\frac{L_z^2}{m^2l^4}\frac{1 + 2\cos^2\theta_0}{\sin^4\theta_0} + \frac{g}{l}\cos\theta_0\right)\delta\theta
$$

Inserting our expression for the equilibrium value of $$L_z$$ we obtain:

$$
\ddot{\delta \theta} = -\frac{g}{l}\frac{1 + 3\cos^2\theta_0}{\cos\theta_0}\delta\theta.
$$

Since $$\cos\theta_0 > 0$$ for $$0 \leq \theta_0 < \frac{\pi}{2}$$, the sign of the second derivative is negative and hence <span style="color:blue">the circular orbits are stable below the fixed point</span> (and for $$\theta_0 \geq \frac{\pi}{2}$$ the second derivative becomes positive and so <span style="color:blue">the orbit/equilibrium is unstable</span>). For these stable circular orbits, the oscillation frequency $$\Omega$$ about the circular orbit as a function of the height/angle $$\theta_0$$ is:

$$
\color{blue}{\Omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{l}\frac{1 + 3\cos^2\theta_0}{\cos\theta_0}}.}
$$

#### Superconducting Microwave Resonator <a id="problem-qm-scmicroresonator" name="problem-qm-scmicroresonator"></a>
**Source:** UBC Spring 2024 Physics Qualifying Exam Q1

**Problem Statement:** *A superconducting microwave resonator is a small loop with an inductance of $$L$$ and a capacitance of $$C$$. It can be modelled quantum-mechanically. Its quantum state can be described by the charge $$Q$$ on the capacitor and the magnetic flux $$\phi$$ through the loop. The operators for these quantities satisfy an uncertainty relation $$[\hat{Q}, \hat{\phi}] = i\hbar$$. Write down the Hamiltonian for this system, and determine its ground state energy.*

**Solution:** We start by analyzing the system using knowing what we know about circuits in a classical setting, then promote the classical variables by classical quantization to obtain the quantum Hamiltonian and ground state energy.

The potential drop across a capacitor with charge $$dQ$$ and capacitance $$C$$ is:

$$
V_{\text{cap}}= \frac{Q}{C}
$$

and hence the energy stored by adding infinitesimal charge $$dQ$$ is:

$$
dE_{\text{cap}} = VdQ= \frac{Q}{C}dQ.
$$

Thus if we charge up the capacitor from 0 charge to final charge $$Q$$ we can integrate the above to obtain the total stored energy in the capacitor:

$$
E_{\text{cap}} = \frac{1}{2C}Q^2.
$$

Next, the potential drop across an inductor is:

$$
V_{\text{ind}} = L\dot{I} = \dot{\phi}
$$

where the second equality follows via Faraday's law. Integrating both sides of the second equality from zero current/flux at $$t = 0$$ to a final current/flux of $$I$$ and $$\phi$$, we obtain:

$$
LI = \phi
$$

Furthermore, the energy stored in the inductor per unit time (using $$P = IV$$) is:

$$
\dot{E}_{\text{ind}} = IV_{\text{ind}} = LI\dot{I}
$$

Therefore the energy stored per infinitesimal current $$dI$$ is:

$$
dE_{\text{ind}} = LIdI
$$

Thus if we go from 0 current to final current $$I$$ the inductor stores energy:

$$
E_{\text{ind}} = \frac{1}{2}LI^2.
$$

Rewriting this in terms of $$\phi$$:

$$
E_{\text{ind}} = \frac{1}{2L}\phi^2
$$

Thus we have determined the energy of the system in terms of $$L, C, Q, \phi$$ to be:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2C} Q^2 + \frac{1}{2L}\phi^2.
$$

Via canonical quantization we promote the classical variables $$Q, \phi$$ to quantum operators $$\hat{Q}, \hat{\phi}$$ and thus the energy $$E$$ to the Hamiltonian $$\hat{H}$$, thus obtaining:

$$
\color{blue}{\hat{H} = \frac{1}{2C}\hat{Q}^2 + \frac{1}{2L}\hat{\phi}^2.}
$$

To find the ground state energy, we note the similarities of the above Hamiltonian with that of the quantum harmonic oscillator:

$$
\hat{H}_{\text{HO}} = \frac{1}{2}k\hat{x}^2 + \frac{1}{2m}\hat{p}^2
$$

which has eigenenergies $$E_n = \hbar\omega(n + \frac{1}{2})$$ with $$\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$$. Since $$\hat{Q}, \hat{\phi}$$ obey the same (canonical) commutation relations as $$\hat{x}, \hat{p}$$ and this is the only algebraic data necessary to determine the eigenenergies, $$\hat{H}$$ has the same eigenenergies (just replacing $$k = \frac{1}{C}, m = L$$) ans so the ground state energy of the system is:

$$
\color{blue}{E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar\sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}.}
$$

#### Rigid Rotor in Magnetic Field <a id="problem-qm-rigidrotor" name="problem-qm-rigidrotor"></a>
**Source:** UBC PHYS 402 2022 Final Q4

**Problem Statement:** *The Hamiltonian of a rigid rotor placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to its axis takes the approximate:*
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rigidrotor}
H = \alpha L^2 + \beta L_z + \gamma L_x
\end{equation}
with $$\alpha, \beta, \gamma$$ real and $$L_i$$ the angular momentum operators.

*(a) Show that the exact eigenenergies are given by:*
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exact}
E_{l, m} = \alpha \hbar^2l(l+1) + \sqrt{\beta^2 + \gamma^2}\hbar m.
\end{equation}

*(b) Assuming $\gamma \ll \beta$, use perturbation theory to lowest non-vanishing order to independently obtain approximate energy eigenvalues.*

*(c) Check consistency between the results in (a) and (b)*

**Solution:** (a) We can exactly solve the problem via a coordinate transformation. In particular, we rotate the system about the $$y$$-axis by angle $$\theta$$ such that $$\tan\theta = \gamma/\beta$$. This gives us the transformed Hamiltonian:

$$
H = \alpha L^2 + \sqrt{\beta^2 + \gamma^2}L_z'
$$

where we note that $$L^2$$ is invariant under rotations and $$L_z'$$ is the $$z$$-angular momentum operator in the transformed coordiante system. Since $$[L^2, L_z'] = 0$$, they share a simultaneous eigenbasis, and labelling the eigenstates as $$\lvert l, m' \rangle$$ we find the eigenergies to be:

$$
\color{blue}{E_{l, m'} = \alpha \hbar^2l(l+1) + \sqrt{\beta^2 + \gamma^2}\hbar m'}
$$

as claimed.

(b) The perturbation theory, we take the base Hamiltonian to be $$H_0 = \alpha L^2 + \beta L_z$$ and the perturbation to be $$H' = \gamma L_x = \gamma\frac{L_+ + L_-}{2}$$ where we write $$L_x$$ in terms of the raising/lowering operators of angular momentum. The eigenbasis of $$H_0$$ is $$\lvert l, m\rangle$$. Thus, the zeroth order energy eigenvalues are:

$$
E^{(0)}_{l, m} = \alpha\hbar^2l(l+1) + \beta\hbar m.
$$

Computing the first order corrections, we find:

$$
E^{(1)}_{l, m} = \langle l, m \rvert H' \lvert l, m \rangle = \frac{\gamma}{2}\langle l, m \rvert (L_+ + L_-)\lvert l, m \rangle = 0.
$$

These vanish and we must go to second order:

$$
E^{(2)}_{l, m} = \sum_{l', m' \neq l, m} \frac{\lvert \langle l, m \vert H' \lvert l', m' \rangle \rvert^2}{E^{(0)}_{l, m} - E^{(0)}_{l', m'}} = \frac{\gamma^2\hbar^2}{4}\left[\frac{l(l+1) - m(m-1)}{E^{(0)}_{l, m} - E^{(0)}_{l, m-1}} + \frac{l(l+1) - m(m+1)}{E^{(0)}_{l, m} - E^{(0)}_{l, m+1}}\right]
$$

Substituing in the zeroth order energies we find:

$$
\color{blue}{E^{(2)}_{l, m} = \frac{\gamma^2\hbar m}{2\beta}}.
$$

(c) We Taylor expand the exact result in (a) in powers of (small) $$\gamma/\beta$$:

$$
E_{l, m} = \alpha \hbar^2 l(l+1) + \beta\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\right)^2}\hbar m = \alpha \hbar^2 l(l+1) + \beta\left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\right)^2\right)\hbar m + O(\left(\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\right)^3)
$$

thus:

$$
\color{blue}{E_{l, m} = \alpha\hbar^2l(l+1) + \beta\hbar m + \frac{\gamma^2\hbar m}{2\beta} + O(\left(\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\right)^3)}
$$

and the exact result agrees to perturbation theory to second order.

#### Spin-Orbit Coupling in the 3-D Harmonic Oscillator <a id="problem-qm-spinorbitqho" name="problem-qm-spinorbitqho"></a>
**Source:** UChicago 2014 Quantum Mechanics Graduate Diagnostic Exam Q2

**Problem Statement:** *Consider a spin 1/2 particle of mass $$m$$ moving in a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential:*
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3dqho}
V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2
\end{equation}
*with $$r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$$.*

*(a) What are the energy and degeneracy (including spin) of the ground state(s) and the first excited state(s) of this system?*

*(b) The general form of the spin-orbit coupling for a particle of mass m and spin \mathbf{S} moving in a radial potential $$V(r)$$ is:*
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spinorbit}
H_{s-o} = \frac{1}{2m^2c^2}\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{L} \frac{1}{r}\frac{dV(r)}{dr}
\end{equation}
*What are the corrections to the ground state and first excited state energy eigenvalues for a spin 1/2 particle in the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential above when this spin-orbit interaction is included?*

**Solution:** (a) We can write the 3-D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian as the sum of 1-D harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:

$$
H_{3D} = \frac{\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} + V(r) = \frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = H_{x} + H_y + H_z
$$

Thus the eigenstates of $$H_{3D}$$ are simply the tensor product of the eigenstates of the 1D harmonic oscillators in each direction, denoted by the four (including spin) quantum numbers to be $$\lvert n_x, n_y, n_z, s_z \rangle$$, and with energies:

$$
E_{n_x, n_y, n_z, s_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = \hbar\omega(n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar\omega(n_y + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar\omega(n_z + \frac{1}{2}) = \hbar\omega(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}).
$$

Thus the ground state energy is obtained by taking $$n_x = n_y = n_z = 0$$:

$$
\color{blue}{E_{g} = \frac{3}{2}\hbar\omega}
$$

which is <span style="color:blue">2-fold degenerate</span> due to the spin (which can be $$\pm 1/2$$). The first excited state has one of the $$n_i$$ equal to one and the rest to 0, and has energy:

$$
\color{blue}{E_{1-ex} = \frac{5}{2}\hbar\omega.}
$$

There are three options for which of the $$n_i$$ are one and two choices for the spin state, and thus this state is <span style="color:blue">6-fold degenerate</span>.

(b) We first convert the eigenstates of the previous section to be eigenstates of the angular momentum operators $$L^2$$ and $$L_z$$. First, we note that $$L_i = \epsilon_{ijk}r_jp_k$$ (with $$\epsilon_{ijk}$$ the Levi-Civita symbol and using the Einstein summation notation), and that we can express the position/momentum operators in terms of the raising/lowering operators $$a_i^\dagger/a_i$$ as:

$$
r_i = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}(a_i^\dagger + a_i)
$$

$$
p_i = i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}}(a_i^\dagger - a_i).
$$

Thus we can express the angular momentum operators in terms of the raising/lowering operators:

$$
L_i = i\hbar\epsilon_{ijk}a_ja_k^\dagger
$$

$$
L^2 = L_iL_i = \hbar^2(N(N+1) - a_k^\dagger a_k^\dagger a_j a_j)
$$
where repeated indices are summed over and $$N = a_i^\dagger a_i$$ is the (total) number operator.

Using these expressions, we find that the states $$\lvert n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0, s_z=\pm 1/2 \rangle$$ of the last section are eigenstates of $$L^2$$ and $$L_z$$ with eigenvalue zero (using that $$a_j\lvert n_j = 0 \rangle = 0$$), and thus we may write them as angular momentum eigenstates of $$\lvert l=0, m=0, s=1/2, s_z=\pm 1/2 \rangle$$. 

The first excited states with one quanta are eigenstates of $$L^2$$ - the $$a_ja_j$$ term vanishes and we are left with $$L^2 = \hbar^2l(l+1) = \hbar^2(1)(1+1) = 2\hbar^2$$. The $$\lvert n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=1, s_z=\pm 1/2 \rangle$$ states are also an eigenstate of $$L_z$$ (with eigenvalue 0) and can be identified with $$\lvert l=1, m=0, s=1/2, s_z=\pm 1/2 \rangle$$. The other two states are not immediately eigenstates of $$L_z$$ but by taking linear combinations we obtain:

$$
\lvert l = 1, m = \pm 1, s=1/2, s_z = \pm 1/2 \rangle = \frac{\lvert n_x=1, n_y = 0, n_z = 0, s_z = \pm 1/2\rangle \pm \lvert n_x=0, n_y = 1, n_z = 0, s_z = \pm 1/2\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
$$

We now have a basis more convenient for thinking about spin-orbit coupling. We treat the spin-orbit coupling as a perturbation, with the form:

$$
H_{s-o} = \frac{1}{2m^2c^2}\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{L} \frac{1}{r}\frac{dV(r)}{dr} = \frac{1}{2m^2c^2}\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{L} \frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 2r\right) = \frac{\omega^2}{mc^2}\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{L}
$$ 

The $$\lvert l, m, s, s_z \rangle$$ basis we use is inconvenient for calculating the energy corrections as these states are not eigenstates of $$\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{L}$$. However, defining the joint angular momentum $$J_i = L_i + S_i$$ we find that $$J^2 = L^2 + S^2 + 2\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{L}$$ and so $$\mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{L} = \frac{J^2 - L^2 - S^2}{2}$$. Thus we will find it convenient to work in the $$\lvert j, j_z, l, s\rangle$$ basis. To this end we note:

$$
\lvert j=1/2, j_z = \pm 1/2, l = 0, s = 1/2 \rangle = \lvert l = 0, m = 0, s = 1/2, s_z = \pm 1/2 \rangle
$$

$$
\lvert j=3/2, j_z = \pm 3/2, l = 1, s = 1/2 \rangle = \lvert l = 1, m = \pm 1, s = 1/2, s_z = \pm 1/2 \rangle
$$

$$
\lvert j=3/2, j_z = 1/2, l = 1, s = 1/2 \rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\lvert l=1, m=1, s=1/2, s_z=-1/2\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\lvert l=1, m=0, s=1/2, s_z=1/2\rangle
$$

$$
\lvert j=1/2, j_z = 1/2, l = 1, s = 1/2 \rangle = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\lvert l=1, m=1, s=1/2, s_z=-1/2\rangle - \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\lvert l=1, m=0, s=1/2, s_z=1/2\rangle
$$

$$
\lvert j=3/2, j_z = -1/2, l = 1, s = 1/2 \rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\lvert l=1, m=-1, s=1/2, s_z=1/2\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\lvert l=1, m=0, s=1/2, s_z=-1/2\rangle
$$

$$
\lvert j=1/2, j_z = -1/2, l = 1, s = 1/2 \rangle = -\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\lvert l=1, m=-1, s=1/2, s_z=1/2\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\lvert l=1, m=0, s=1/2, s_z=-1/2\rangle.
$$

These equations can be obtained by comparing the quantum numbers on each side, with the coefficients in the last four equations being determined with the help of a Clebsh-Gordon table (Note: to do this part of the question properly, we could apply the raising/lowering operators of angular momentum to find the coefficients (and indeed this is how the CG-table is derived). However, the exact coefficients presented here are not strictly relevant for solving the problem, and so we omit this (slightly tedious) step of the calculation). With this basis transformation established, we can compute the energy corrections using first-order perturbation theory:

$$
E^{(1)}_{j, j_z, l, s} = \langle j, j_z, l, s \rvert H_{s-0} \lvert j, j_z, l, s \rangle = \frac{\omega^2}{mc^2}\langle j, j_z, l, s \rvert \frac{J^2 - L^2 - S^2}{2} \lvert j, j_z, l, s \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2\omega^2}{2mc^2}(j(j+1) - l(l+1) - s(s+1))
$$

Thus for the ground state(s) with $$l = 0$$, $$s = 1/2$$ and $$j = 1/2$$ we find:

$$
\color{blue}{E^{(1)}_{j=1, j_z=\pm 1/2, l=0, s=1/2} = \frac{\hbar^2\omega^2}{2mc^2}(\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2} + 1) - 0(0+1) - \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2} + 1)) = 0.}
$$

Note that we could have deduced this without any calculation, as the ground state(s) are spherically symmetric, and spin-orbit coupling does not impact such states. For the first excited state(s), the energy correction depends on the total angular momenta, as there are $$j = 3/2$$ and $$j = 1/2$$ sectors:

$$
\color{blue}{E^{(1)}_{j=3/2, j_z=\pm 3/2 \pm 1/2, l=1, s=1/2} = \frac{\hbar^2\omega^2}{2mc^2}(\frac{3}{2}(\frac{3}{2} + 1) - 1(1+1) - \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2} + 1)) = \frac{\hbar^2\omega^2}{2mc^2}.}
$$

$$
\color{blue}{E^{(1)}_{j=1/2, j_z=\pm 1/2, l=1, s=1/2} = \frac{\hbar^2\omega^2}{2mc^2}(\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2} + 1) - 1(1+1) - \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2} + 1)) = -\frac{\hbar^2\omega^2}{mc^2}.}
$$

#### Identical Particles in an Infinite Cubic Well <a id="problem-qm-identicalcubicwell" name="problem-qm-identicalcubicwell"></a>
**Source:** UChicago 2014 Quantum Mechanics Graduate Diagnostic Exam Q3

**Problem Statement:** *(a) First, consider a single particle of mass $$m$$ in a three-dimensional box of dimensions $$L \times L \times L/4$$:*

\begin{equation}\label{eq:infcubicwell}
V(x, y, z) = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq L, 0 \leq y \leq L, 0 \leq z \leq L/4 
\\ \infty & \text{otherwise.} 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

*Find the three lowest energy eigenvalues and all the corresponding eigenfunctions of the particle in the box. Express all energies in units of $$\epsilon_0 = \frac{\hbar^2\pi^2}{2mL^2}$$.* 

*(b) Now suppose that we place three identical spin-0 particles in the box. For the combined system of three particles, find the two lowest eigenvalues of the total energy. Find the degeneracy associated with each of these eigenvalues (i.e. find the total number of distinct three-particle states corresponding to each eigenvalue).*

*(c) Repeat part (b) for spin-1/2 particles.*

*(d) Repeat part (b) for spin-1 particles.*

**Solution:** We can solve the problem independently in $$x, y, z$$ and then combine the eigenvalues/eigenfunctions to obtain the 3D solution. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the 1-D infinite square well of length $$L$$ are $$E_n, \psi_n(x)$$ where:

$$
E_n = \frac{\hbar^2\pi^2 n^2}{2mL^2} = \epsilon_0 n^2
$$

$$
\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})
$$

Thus the eigenvalues/eigenfunctions of the 3D cubic infinite square well are labelled by quantum numbers $$n_x, n_y, n_z$$, with:

$$
E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \epsilon_0 n_x^2+ \epsilon_0 n_y^2 + 16\epsilon_0 n_z^2
$$

$$
\psi_{n_x, n_y, n_z}(x, y, z) = \psi_{n_x}(x)\psi_{n_y}(y)\psi_{n_z}(4z) = 2\left(\frac{2}{L}\right)^{3/2}\sin(\frac{n_x\pi x}{L})\sin(\frac{n_y\pi y}{L})\sin(\frac{n_z 4 \pi z}{L})
$$

where $$n_i \in \mathbb{N}$$ and we note that the length is $$L/4$$ in the $$z$$-direction. From this, we can easily read off the three lowest eigenenergies to be $$\color{blue}{E_{1, 1, 1} = 18\epsilon_0, E_{2, 1, 1} = E_{1, 2, 1} = 19\epsilon_0, E_{2, 2, 1} = 20\epsilon_0}$$. With the respective eigenfunctions given in the equation above with the corresponding $$n_x, n_y, n_z$$.

(b) We first note the celebrated *spin-statistics theorem*, which tells us that bosons have integer spin and fermions have half-integer spin. Thus the spin-0 particles here are bosons, which can occupy the same quantum state. They each only have a single $$s = 0$$ spin state, and thus this does not enter into the degeneracy.

The lowest eigenvalue is with all three particles in the $$(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1, 1, 1)$$ state, with a total energy of $$3 \cdot 18 \epsilon_0 = \color{blue}{54\epsilon_0}$$ with <span style="color:blue">no degeneracy</span>. The next lowest eigenvalue is with one particle in either $$(2, 1, 1)$$ or $$(1, 2, 1)$$ with the other two particles in the $$(1, 1, 1)$$ state, giving a total energy of $$2 \cdot 18\epsilon_0 + 19\epsilon_0 = \color{blue}{55\epsilon_0}$$. Since the particles are indistinguishable, the only choice is whether the more energetic particle is in $$(2, 1, 1)$$ or $$(1, 2, 1)$$ and thus this eigenvalue is <span style="color:blue">2-fold degenerate</span>.

(c) The spin-1/2 particles are fermions, which obey Pauli exclusion - hence any two particles cannot be in the same state. We also note that there is an additional quantum number for spin with $$s_z = \pm 1/2$$ - this does not affect the energy of the single-particle states, but will enter into our considerations of degeneracy.

The lowest eigenvalue is with one particle in $$(n_x, n_y, n_z, s_z) = (1, 1, 1, 1/2)$$, another in $$(1, 1, 1, -1/2)$$, and the last particle in one of $$(2, 1, 1, \pm 1/2)$$ or $$(1, 2, 1, \pm 1/2)$$. Hence the eigenvalue is $$\color{blue}{55\epsilon_0}$$ with <span style="color:blue">4-fold degeneracy</span>. The second lowest eigenvalue is $$\color{blue}{56\epsilon_0}$$, which has combinations of one particle in $$(1, 1, 1, \pm 1/2)$$, and the other two particles being in $$(2, 1, 1, \pm 1/2)$$ or $$(1, 2, 1, \pm 1/2)$$ states (so long as they are not in the same state). There are $$2 \cdot 6 = 12$$ possible choices in this way. Another possibility is for one particle in $$(1, 1, 1, 1/2)$$, the second in $$(1, 1, 1, -1/2)$$, and the last in $$(2, 2, 1, \pm 1/2)$$. There are 2 possible choices in this configuration. Thus in total this eigenvalue is <span style="color:blue">14-fold degenerate</span>.

(d) The spin-1 particles are bosons. They can occupy the same state, and have the spin quantum number $$s_z = -1, 0, 1$$. This again does not affect the energy of the single particle states, but will again enter in degeneracy counting.

The lowest eigenvalue is with all particles in $$(n_x, n_y, n_z, s_z) = (1, 1, 1, s_z)$$ states, with eigenvalue $$\color{blue}{54\epsilon_0}$$. The possibilities for the spins are all $$+1$$, all $$0$$, all $$-1$$, two $$+1$$/one $$0$$ or $$-1$$, two $$0$$/one $$+1$$ or $$-1$$, two $$-1$$/one $$+1$$ or $$0$$. Thus this eigenvalue is <span style="color:blue">9-fold degenerate</span>. The next lowest eigenvalue is $$\color{blue}{55\epsilon_0}$$. Here two particles are in $$(1, 1, 1, s_z)$$ and one particle is in $$(2, 1, 1, s_z)$$ or $$(1, 2, 1, s_z)$$. There are 6 choices for the excited particle (3 for the spin state, 2 for which of $$n_x, n_y$$ is 2) and 6 choices for the spin states of the ground state particles (both $$+1$$, both $$0$$, both $$-1$$, one $$+1$$/one $$0$$, one $$+1$$/one $$-1$$, one $$0$$/one $$-1$$) and by multiplying we find <span style="color:blue">36-fold degeneracy</span>.

#### Measuring a Two-Spin System <a id="problem-qm-twospinmeasurement" name="problem-qm-twospinmeasurement"></a>
**Source:** UBC Spring 2024 Physics Qualifying Exam Q6

**Problem Statement:** *Many copies of a system of two spin-1/2 particles are prepared in an identical spin state given by:*
\begin{equation}\label{eq:twospins}
\lvert \psi \rangle = a\lvert \uparrow\uparrow \rangle + b\lvert \uparrow \downarrow \rangle + c\lvert \downarrow \uparrow \rangle + d\lvert \downarrow \downarrow \rangle
\end{equation}
*An experimenter performs many measurements of these identical systems, and finds the following results:*
- *If only the first spin is measured, the result is spin up with 30% probability.*
- *If only the second spin is measured, the result is spin up with 40% probability.*
- *If both spins are measured, the result is both spins up with 10% probability.*
*Derive the upper and lower limits on the probability that a measurement of the total spin of this state will yield zero.*

**Solution:** From the experimental data (and the Born rule), we know that $$\lvert a \rvert^2 + \lvert b \rvert^2 = 3/10$$, $$\lvert a \rvert^2 + \lvert c \rvert^2 = 4/10$$, and $$\lvert a \rvert^2 = 1/10$$. For completeness' sake let us go through the full calculation for the first of these. The probability of measuring the first spin to be spin up is given by the Born rule to be:

$$p(s_1 = \uparrow) = \rangle \psi \lvert \Pi_1^{\uparrow} \otimes I_2 \lvert \psi \rangle$$

Where $$\Pi_{\uparrow}^{(1)} = \lvert \uparrow \rangle_1 \langle \uparrow \rvert_1$$ is the projector onto the $$\uparrow$$ state for the first spin and $$I_2$$ is the identity matrix on the second spin. Thus using that $$\langle \uparrow \vert \uparrow \rangle = 1$$ and $$\langle \uparrow \vert \downarrow \rangle = 0$$ we find:

$$
p(s_1 = \uparrow) = (a^*\langle \uparrow \rvert_2 + b^* \langle \downarrow \rvert_2)(a\lvert \uparrow \rangle_2 + b\lvert \downarrow \rangle_2) = \lvert a \rvert^2 + \lvert b \rvert^2
$$

which from the experimental data is equal to $$3/10$$. Analogous calculations follow for the other cases.

Now, substituting the third expression into the first/second we find that $$\lvert b \rvert^2 = 2/10$$ and $$\lvert c \rvert^2 = 3/10$$, and from the normalization of the state it must hold that:

$$
\lvert a \rvert^2 + \lvert b \rvert^2 + \lvert c \rvert^2 + \lvert d \rvert^2 = 1
$$

from which we find that $$\lvert d \rvert^2 = 4/10$$. The question asks for the probability that we measure the total spin of the state to be zero. To this end we rewrite the state in the $$\lvert s m \rvert$$ basis, with: $$ \lvert 1 1 \rangle = \lvert \uparrow \uparrow \rangle$$, $$ \lvert 1 -1 \rangle = \lvert \downarrow \downarrow \rangle$$, $$\lvert 1 0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\lvert \uparrow \downarrow \rangle + \lvert \downarrow \uparrow \rangle)$$ and $$\lvert 0 0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\lvert \uparrow \downarrow \rangle - \lvert \downarrow \uparrow \rangle)$$. Thus:

$$
\lvert \psi \rangle = a\lvert 1 1 \rangle + \frac{b + c}{\sqrt{2}}\lvert 1 0 \rangle + \frac{b - c}{\sqrt{2}}\lvert 0 0 \rangle + d\lvert 1 -1 \rangle
$$

We are interested in the probability of measuring $$s = 0$$, and hence:

$$
p(s=0) = \lvert\frac{b - c}{\sqrt{2}} \rvert^2 = \frac{1}{2}(\lvert b \rvert^2 + \lvert c \rvert^2 - b^*c - bc^*) = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2} - b^*c - bc^*)
$$

where in the last equality we use the known values of $$\lvert b \rvert^2$$ and $$\lvert c \rvert^2$$. $$b, c$$ have undetermined phases with $$b = e^{i\phi_b}\sqrt{\frac{2}{10}}$$ and $$c = e^{i\phi_c}\sqrt{\frac{3}{10}}$$. We thus determine the upper and lower bounds on:

$$
-(b^*c + bc^*) = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{10}(e^{i(-\phi_b + \phi_c)} + e^{i(\phi_b - \phi_c)}) = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{5}\cos(\phi)
$$
where we defined $$\phi = \phi_b - \phi_c$$ and applied Euler's identity. This quantity maximized when $$\phi = \pi$$ for which we have:

$$
\color{blue}{p(s=0)_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{6}}{10}.}
$$

Conversely, we have the minimum when $$\phi = 0$$ for which:

$$
\color{blue}{p(s=0)_{\text{min}} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{6}}{10}.}
$$


### 4. Statistical Mechanics <a id="sec-sm" name="sec-sm"></a>
#### Lennard-Jones Crystal <a id="problem-sm-lennardjonescrystal" name="problem-sm-lennardjonescrystal"></a>
**Source:** UBC Spring 2024 Physics Qualifying Exam Q4

**Problem Statement:** *The interaction potential between atoms of mass $M$ is given by a Lennard-Jones potential:*
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lennardjones}
u(x) = \frac{A}{x^{12}} - \frac{B}{x^6}
\end{equation}
*Here $A$ and $B$ are positive constants. Consider a crystal formed from these atoms, with a cubic lattice structure. Calculate the density of the crystal. Give an expression for its specific heat capacity in the low temperature limit. Consider only the interactions of each atom with its six nearest neighbours. Calculate as well the approximate binding energy of the quantum mechanical ground state for the diatomic molecule formed from these atoms.*

**Solution:** We first find the equilibrium spacing $$x_0$$ that minimizes the potential energy. To this end we set the derivative of $$u(x)$$ to zero:

$$
\left.\frac{du}{dx}\right|_{x=x_0} = -12\frac{A}{x_0^{13}} + 6\frac{B}{x_0^7} = 0 \implies x_0 = \sqrt[6]{\frac{2A}{B}}
$$

At equilibrium the atoms in the crystal are all $$x_0$$ apart, and hence there is a single atom inside a cube of volume $$x_0^3$$; hence the number density of the crystal is:

$$
\color{blue}{\rho = \frac{N}{V} = \frac{1}{x_0^3} = \sqrt{\frac{B}{2A}}}
$$

and the mass density is obtained by multiplying the above by $$M$$, The high-temperature limit of the heat capacity is simple; each atom in the crystal has 6 degrees of freedom (3 translational and 3 vibrational) which contributes $$\frac{1}{2}kT$$ energy via the equipartition theorem, and thus the energy is $$U = 6 \frac{1}{2}NkT = 3NkT$$ and the specific heat capacity is $$C_V = \frac{dU}{dT} = 3Nk$$ (the Dulong-Petit Law). The low-temperature heat capacity requires more careful thought. First, since we consider the low-temperature limit, we can approximate the interatomic potential by Taylor expansion around the minimum $$x = x_0$$. This yields:

$$
u(x) \approx u(x_0) + \left.\frac{du}{dx}\right|_{x=x_0}(x - x_0) + \left.\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}\right|_{x=x_0}(x-x_0)^2 = -\frac{B^2}{4A} + 0 + \left(\frac{156A}{x_0^{14}} - \frac{42B}{x_0^8}\right)(x - x_0)^2
$$

We can drop the constant term (it will not matter for the heat capacity) and define $$\frac{1}{2}k = \left(\frac{156A}{x_0^{14}} - \frac{42B}{x_0^8}\right)$$. Now, in a significant approximation we calculate the heat capacity assuming that each of atoms in the crystal can be treated as independent Harmonic oscillators (this is the so-called ``Einstein model'' of solids - a more accurate low-$T$ picture can be obtained using the Debye theory of solids (as discussed in the PHYS 502 lecture notes [here](/notes/)) but this seemed too complicated/esoteric to be derived in an exam setting, so we take the simpler approach). In particular, each atom oscillates independently in $x, y, z$ and so we have $3N$ harmonic oscillators in the crystal in total, with energies given by:

$$
E_n = \hbar\omega\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)
$$

with $$\omega = \sqrt{k/M}$$. We drop the zero-point energy as it does not contribute to the heat capacity. The partition function for a single one of these oscillators is then:

$$
Z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \exp(-\beta E_n) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \exp\left(-\hbar\omega\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right) = \frac{\exp(-\beta \hbar \omega/2)}{1 - \exp(-\beta\hbar\omega)}
$$

where $$\beta = \frac{1}{kT}$$ and we use the geometric series in the last equality. The mean energy per oscillator is then:

$$
U = -\frac{d\ln Z}{d\beta} = \frac{\hbar\omega}{2} + \frac{\hbar\omega}{\exp(\beta\hbar\omega) - 1}
$$

so the mean total energy of the crystal is:
$$
U = 3N \left(\frac{\hbar\omega}{2} + \frac{\hbar\omega}{\exp(\beta\hbar\omega) - 1}\right)
$$

and thus we can obtain the heat capacity:

$$
C_V = \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} = -k\beta^2 \frac{\partial U}{\partial \beta} = 3Nk\frac{(\beta\hbar\omega)^2\exp(\beta\hbar\omega)}{(\exp(\beta\hbar\omega) - 1)^2}
$$

which in the low $$T$$ limit becomes:

$$
\color{blue}{C_V = 3Nk(\beta\hbar\omega)^2\exp(-\beta\hbar\omega).}
$$

The binding energy for the quantum mechanical ground state for the diatomic molecule formed by these atoms is simply the energy needed to break apart the atoms from the equilibrium distance $x_0$ to infinity. The energy at the equilibrium distance was calculated in the Taylor expansion to be $$-\frac{B^2}{2A}$$, and to this we can add the zero point energy of $$\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$$. At infinity we have $$\lim_{x \to \infty}u(x) = 0$$ and so the binding energy is simply the ground state energy:

$$
\color{blue}{E_0 = -\frac{B^2}{2A} + \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega.}
$$
