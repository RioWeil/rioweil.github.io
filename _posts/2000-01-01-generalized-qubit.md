**Date.** *The density operator is discussed in quantum mechanics courses as a generalization of the state ket, allowing one to represent probabilistic mixtures. In this post, we provide a geometric visualization of this generalization, by showing how the qubit state ket on the Bloch sphere extends to the Bloch ball in the density operator formalism.*
