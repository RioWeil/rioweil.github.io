### ASTR 403: Cosmology Poster
- **Files:** [Poster](/assets/pdf/projects/courses/a403-poster.pdf)
- **Description:** A poster discussing the uses of the (classical) Metropolis-Hasting Algorithm and (quantum) variational eigensolver algorithms in contemporary cosmology.

### PHYS 319: Microcontroller Tuner
- **Files:** [Report](/assets/pdf/projects/courses/p319-report.pdf) - [Slides](/assets/pdf/projects/courses/p319-presentation.pdf)
- **Description:** A report detailing the construction of a tuner made with a MSP-430 microcontroller and other electronic components. A set of codes and a notebook detailing my adventure with this cursed microcontroller can be found [here](https://github.com/RioWeil/PHYS319-MSP430), including (but not limited to) a program to Rickroll your favourite TAs using nothing but an MSP and a buzzer. 

### CPSC 210: Quantum Circuit Simulator
- **Files:** [Code (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/onetwo-qubit-quantum-circuit) - [Video (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlA9VmnsXTQ)
- **Description:** A java app that can simulate one/two qubit quantum circuits. Admittedly super limited, but a fun exercise to learn a new language nonetheless. I don't think the [IBM Quantum Composer](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/files/new) can be topped, anyway.
