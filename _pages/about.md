My research at UBC is in the field of quantum computation and quantum information theory, under the supervision of Dr. [Robert Raussendorf](https://phas.ubc.ca/~raussen/). I also work as a contractor for the Quantum Architecture Team at [Xanadu](https://www.xanadu.ai), where I was a [2023 research resident](https://www.xanadu.ai/blog/Xanadu-2023-Residency-Program). Broadly, I am interested in understanding the source of the computational speedup that quantum computers have over their classical counterparts and fault-tolerance. Specifically, I work on realizations of computational phases of matter on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and topological and photonic quantum error correction. 

I graduated with a BSc in Combined Honours in Physics and Mathematics (with distinction) from UBC in May 2022. My [honours thesis](/assets/pdf/papers/bach_thesis.pdf) was on algorithms for symmetry-protected MBQC experiments, supervised by Dr. Robert Raussendorf.

My CV can be found [here](/assets/pdf/cv/cv.pdf).

Outside of research, I enjoy teaching and outreach (I used to coordinate the [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/)). When I'm not thinking about physics, I like to spend my time bouldering, playing indie games, and listening to/playing music (you can find songs from my a cappella group Choral Reef [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/UBCacappella/videos)).
