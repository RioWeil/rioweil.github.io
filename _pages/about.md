My research is in the field of quantum computation and quantum information theory, under the supervision of Dr. [Robert Raussendorf](https://phas.ubc.ca/~raussen/). Broadly, I am interested in understanding the source of the computational speedup that quantum computers have over their classical counterparts. Specifically, my work centers around understanding the computational capabilities of measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) resource states. I also have an interest in quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning, and quantum compilation.

I graduated with a BSc in Combined Honours in Physics and Mathematics from UBC in May 2022. My honours thesis was on [algorithms for MBQC experiments](/assets/pdf/papers/bach_thesis.pdf), supervised by Dr. Robert Raussendorf.

My CV can be found [here](/assets/pdf/cv/cv.pdf).

Outside of research, I enjoy teaching and outreach (such as through the [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/)). When I'm not thinking about physics, I like to spend my time biking, playing indie games, and listening to/playing music (you can find songs from my a cappella group Choral Reef [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/UBCacappella/videos)).
