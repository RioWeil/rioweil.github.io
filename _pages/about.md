My research interests lie at the intersection of quantum information and condensed matter theory, where I am interested in questions such as what quantum phases of matter are capable of quantum error correction and computation. Prior to my graduate studies at UChicago, I graduated from the MSc Physics program at [The University of British Columbia](https://phas.ubc.ca), where I conducted research on experimental realizations of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) in symmetric spin chains under the supervision of Dr. [Robert Raussendorf](https://www.itp.uni-hannover.de/en/groups/robert-raussendorf). My MSc thesis can be found [here](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/88841). I was previously a contractor and [2023 research resident](https://www.xanadu.ai/blog/Xanadu-2023-Residency-Program) at Xanadu Quantum Technologies. Before my Masters, I graduated with a BSc in Combined Honours in Physics and Mathematics (with distinction) from UBC in May 2022. My honours thesis can be found [here](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/82098).

My CV can be found [here](/assets/pdf/cv/cv.pdf).

Outside of research, I enjoy teaching and outreach (I used to coordinate the [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/)). When I'm not thinking about physics, I like to spend my time bouldering, playing board games and indie games, trying out coffee shops and restaurants, and listening to/playing music (you can find songs from my former a cappella group Choral Reef [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/UBCacappella/videos) and my arrangements [here](https://rioweil.github.io/music/)).
