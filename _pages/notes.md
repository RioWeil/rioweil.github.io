Below are lecture notes for courses I have taken and/or TA'd. Please send me an [email](mailto:ryoweil6@student.ubc.ca) if you spot any errors!

## Applications of Quantum Mechanics
- **Files:** (Work In Progress) [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/PHYS402-notes)
- **Description:** Notes written for students of UBC's PHYS 402. The course is an advanced undergraduate course in quantum mechanics, covering portions of the first six chapters in Sakurai's *Modern Quantum Mechanics* as well as some additional topics.
- **Topics Covered:** Fundamental concepts/formalism, Quantum dynamics, Quantum foundations and entanglement, Symmetries, Angular momentum, Approximation methods, Identical particles.
- **Pre-requisites:** A first course in quantum mechanics (covering the first four chapters of Griffith's *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics*). However, the theory is developed from the ground up, and formally one only needs linear algebra and some experience with differential equations.

## Real Analysis
- **Files:** [PDF](/assets/pdf/projects/notes/analysis-notes.pdf) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/MATH320-321-notes)
- **Description:** Notes taken from UBC's MATH 320/321. The courses go through the standard undergraduate analysis sequence, covering the first nine chapters of Rudin's *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*.
- **Topics Covered:** The real and complex numbers, cardinality, basic topology, sequences and series, continuity, differentiation, the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, Sequences and series of functions, Power series, Special functions, Fourier series, Multi-variable functions.
- **Pre-requisites:** Familiarity with mathematical proofs. Some calculus background is also helpful.

## Classical Mechanics
- **Files:** [PDF](/assets/pdf/projects/notes/mechanics-notes.pdf) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/PHYS306-notes)
- **Description:** Notes taken from UBC's PHYS 306. The course is a second course in undergraduate classical mechanics, covering chapters 6-7, 9-14, and 16 of Taylor's *Classical Mechanics*.
- **Topics Covered:** Calculus of variations, Lagrangian mechanics, Mechanics in non-inertial frames, Rigid-body rotational mechanics, Coupled oscillators and normal modes, Nonlinear mechanics and chaos, Hamiltonian mechanics, Collision theory, Continuum mechanics.
- **Pre-requisites:** A first course in mechanics (covering at least the first five chapters of Taylor's *Classical Mechanics*).
- **Remark:** These notes were a first attempt at taking live typeset notes, and are therefore the least elegant, by some margin.

## Thermodynamics
- **Files:** [PDF](/assets/pdf/projects/notes/thermo-notes.pdf) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/SCIE001-thermo-notes)
- **Description:** A pseudo-textbook co-written with Justin Lawrence to act as a resource for the thermodynamics unit of UBC's SCIE 001 (first-year honours science).
- **Topics Covered:** The laws of thermodynamics, Microscopic definition of temperature, Degrees of freedom, Ideal gases, Thermodynamic processes, Heat engines, Entropy.
- **Pre-requisites:** Basic mechanics, derivative and integral calculus.
- **Remark:** Includes practice problems and solutions.
