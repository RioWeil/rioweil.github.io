Below are lecture notes for courses I have taken and/or TA'd. Please send me an [email](mailto:ryoheiweil@phas.ubc.ca) if you spot any errors!

### Graduate Statistical Mechanics (PHYS 516)
- **Files:** (Course In Progress) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/PHYS516-notes)
- **Description:** Notes taken (live) from UBC's PHYS 516. The course is a topics course in statistical mechanics.
- **Topics Covered:** Fundamentals of statistical mechanics, Phase transitions and critical exponents, $$D = 1,2,3$$ Ising models, mean field theory, quantum field theory, universality, renormalization, and elementary conformal field theory. 
- **Pre-requisites:** Undergraduate statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics.

### Graduate Quantum Field Theory I (PHYS 526)
- **Files:** [PDF](/assets/pdf/projects/notes/qft-notes.pdf) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/PHYS526-notes)
- **Description:** Notes taken (live) from UBC's PHYS 526. The course is a first course in graduate quantum field theory, and uses Gordon Semenoff's *Quantum Field Theory: A Physicistâ€™s Introduction* as the primary textbook.
- **Topics Covered:** Many-particle systems, Second Quantization, Symmetries and Noether's theorem, Space-time symmetries, Scalar/Tensor/Vector fields, Emergent relativistic QFT, Dirac equation and Dirac QFT, Photons, Quantum Electrodynamics, Functional methods, Perturbation theory, Feynman diagrams, Renormalization of QED. 
- **Pre-requisites:** (Advanced) undergraduate courses in quantum mechanics, special relativity, calculus, differential equations and linear algebra.

### Graduate Condensed Matter Physics I (PHYS 502)
- **Files:** [PDF](/assets/pdf/projects/notes/cm-notes.pdf) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/PHYS502-notes)
- **Description:** Notes taken (live) from UBC's PHYS 502. The course is a first course in graduate condensed matter theory, and uses Aschroft & Mermin's *Solid State Physics* as the primary textbook.
- **Topics Covered:** Solids as interacting quantum many-body systems, Second quantization for fermions and bosons, Electrons in solids, Boson systems, Electrons in periodic potentials, Semiclassical theory of conduction in metals, Electron-phonon interactions, Elements of superconductivity.
- **Pre-requisites:** Undergraduate courses in solid-state physics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics.

### Graduate Quantum Mechanics I (PHYS 500)
- **Files:** [PDF](/assets/pdf/projects/notes/gquantum-notes.pdf) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/PHYS500-notes)
- **Description:** Notes taken (live) from UBC's PHYS 500. The course is a first course in graduate quantum mechanics, and does not follow a set textbook in particular (though primarily references Goswami's *Quantum Mechanics* and Griffith's *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics*).
- **Topics Covered:** Angular momentum and spin, Electromagnetic interactions, Gauge invariance, Addition of angular momentum, Time-independent perturbation theory, Fine and hyperfine structure of Hydrogen, WKB approximation, Time-dependent perturbation theory, Spontaneous Emission, Electric transitions, Selection rules, Adiabatic approximation, Berry phase, Aharonov-Bohm Effect, Scattering and resonance scattering.
- **Pre-requisites:** One or two courses in undergraduate quantum mechanics.

### Quantum Mechanics II (PHYS 402)
- **Files:** (Work In Progress) [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/PHYS402-notes)
- **Description:** Notes written for students of UBC's PHYS 402. The course is an advanced undergraduate course in quantum mechanics, covering portions of the first six chapters in Sakurai's *Modern Quantum Mechanics* as well as some additional topics.
- **Topics Covered:** Fundamental concepts/formalism, Quantum dynamics, Quantum information and foundations, Symmetries, Angular momentum, Approximation methods.
- **Pre-requisites:** A first course in quantum mechanics (covering the first four chapters of Griffith's *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics*). However, the theory is developed from the ground up, and formally one only needs linear algebra and some experience with differential equations.

### Real Analysis I/II (MATH 320/321)
- **Files:** [PDF](/assets/pdf/projects/notes/analysis-notes.pdf) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/MATH320-321-notes)
- **Description:** Notes taken from UBC's MATH 320/321. The courses go through the standard undergraduate analysis sequence, covering the first nine chapters of Rudin's *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*.
- **Topics Covered:** The real and complex numbers, cardinality, basic topology, sequences and series, continuity, differentiation, the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, Sequences and series of functions, Power series, Special functions, Fourier series, Multi-variable functions.
- **Pre-requisites:** Familiarity with mathematical proofs. Some calculus background is also helpful.

### Classical Mechanics II (PHYS 306)
- **Files:** [PDF](/assets/pdf/projects/notes/mechanics-notes.pdf) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/PHYS306-notes)
- **Description:** Notes taken (live) from UBC's PHYS 306. The course is a second course in undergraduate classical mechanics, covering chapters 6-7, 9-14, and 16 of Taylor's *Classical Mechanics*.
- **Topics Covered:** Calculus of variations, Lagrangian mechanics, Mechanics in non-inertial frames, Rigid-body rotational mechanics, Coupled oscillators and normal modes, Nonlinear mechanics and chaos, Hamiltonian mechanics, Collision theory, Continuum mechanics.
- **Pre-requisites:** A first course in mechanics (covering at least the first five chapters of Taylor's *Classical Mechanics*).
- **Remark:** These notes were a first attempt at taking live typeset notes, and are therefore the least elegant, by some margin.

### Thermodynamics I (SCIE 001)
- **Files:** [PDF](/assets/pdf/projects/notes/thermo-notes.pdf) - [TeX Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/RioWeil/SCIE001-thermo-notes)
- **Description:** A pseudo-textbook co-written with Justin Lawrence to act as a resource for the thermodynamics unit of UBC's SCIE 001 (first-year honours science).
- **Topics Covered:** The laws of thermodynamics, Microscopic definition of temperature, Degrees of freedom, Ideal gases, Thermodynamic processes, Heat engines, Entropy.
- **Pre-requisites:** Basic mechanics, derivative and integral calculus.
- **Remark:** Includes practice problems and solutions.
